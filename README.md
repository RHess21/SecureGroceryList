This is my attempt at the Secure programming project. 
I created a grocery list app that allows you to make an account and log into your own. 
I hash the passwords and make sure to check all inputs through a regex and clean all the data before submitting to a DB
I used SQL server management studio to host a local DB for my own purposes.
I would add a logger to this to catch any errors and i would also add saving the grocery lists to the DB
